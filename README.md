## Features

- üîç **Real-Time Detection**: Detects objects in a live webcam feed.
- üé• **Webcam Integration**: Uses browser APIs to access the user's camera.
- üñºÔ∏è **Bounding Boxes**: Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
- üìä **Confidence Scores**: Shows confidence percentages for detected objects.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaksiu12s/TF-LiveObjectDetection
cd TF-LiveObjectDetection
```

### 2. Install npm packages and run app with vite.
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

### 3. If you want to use cross ip on your local network you have to create key certificates with mkcert.
### 4. Then you have to change vite config file from production to commented section.
### 5. You should also have 2 files in the root level of folder. Something like localhost+2-key.pem and localhost+2-key.pem. Change the directory in vite config.
